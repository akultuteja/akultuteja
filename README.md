# 🌦️ Weather App 

This is my first weather app project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the current weather for any city using real-time data from OpenWeatherMap.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- It lets you enter a city name and shows:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Weather condition and icon
  - Feels like temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed

---

## 🚀 How I Built It

- HTML → For the structure
- CSS → For the design
- JavaScript → To connect to the weather API and make it interactive
- OpenWeatherMap API → To get live weather data

---

## 🔧 How to Run It

1. Clone the repo or download it as ZIP
2. Open `index.html` in a browser

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use an API
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Basic project structure
- How to write a README on GitHub 😄

---

## ✨ Next Steps

- Add dark mode 🌙
- Show forecast for the next 5 days 📅
